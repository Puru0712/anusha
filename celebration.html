            <p>Happiest birthday mj, cannot believe you are 21 already, you already know my only wish would be being with you today, I miss being near you, I miss your presence, I miss just looking into your eyes and talking to you, but cheers(with your first legal drink) to spending all of our future birthdays together. Adulthood getting real now, but you are doing so well, I am so proud and happy about everything you are doing for your studies, career and your family, I am so lucky to call you mine you have no idea, I am so grateful that I am loved and cared for by you. You are the most valuable to me. Spending time away from you is the hardest thing ever but just having the thought that you are mine and of what our future together awaits reassures me that every second of it is worth it. We have built something so insane that it boggles my mind how much of my life and my mind is yours. I love talking about you to anyone and everyone just because it reminds me of a memory with you. It is insane that I met the love of my life so early but as they say, you just know man and I ain't ever letting you go Pookie, u're mine. We will, and have already grown up together and I wouldn't do it any other way, looking forward to spending the rest of all our birthdays together, 
                Yours only,
                puruuu
